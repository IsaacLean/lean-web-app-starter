# Lean JavaScript Application Starter

**Lean JS App Starter (LJAS)** is a development environment that is designed to get you up and running as quickly as possible while being open and adaptable to your code's ever-changing needs as your app grows.

-   üéâ **More than just JavaScript & browsers: build servers, desktop apps, CLI tools, and more!**  
    Support for [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [React](https://react.dev), and Node.js servers that handle React server-side rendering.
-   üê≥ **Docker development environment**  
    Alternatively run the dev environment in a [Docker container](https://docker.com) to improve consistency for developers across macOS, Windows, and Linux.
-   üß™ **Robust testing environment**  
    Write unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io) and end-to-end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). Test frontends with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com) and backends with [SuperTest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest). Mock network requests with [MSW](https://mswjs.io).
-   üóÑÔ∏è **Support for PostgreSQL & MongoDB**  
     Connect to [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) and [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com) easily with [Prisma](https://prisma.io). Containerized databases are available so you aren't required to install database directly on your machine.
-   ‚ö° **Hot module replacement & auto-reloading**  
    See changes reflected quickly in your app as soon as you hit save in your code.
-   üì¶ **Optimized builds for production environments**  
    Generate optimized builds specialized for running in production environments. Output cross-browser compatible bundles for the web or OS-specific executable bundles for Linux, macOS, or Windows.
-   ü•á **Powered by the gold standards of the JS build tool ecosystem**  
    Nothing fancy and no surprises‚Äìit's just [webpack](https://webpack.js.org), [Babel](https://babeljs.io), and [ESLint](https://eslint.org). The configurations are intentionally designed to follow standard conventions out-of-the-box, so they are easy to understand and customize if needed.
