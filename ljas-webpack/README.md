This package provides configuration parts used to compose the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) configurations for [Lean JavaScript Application Starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter).

## Installation

`npm install --save-dev ljas-webpack`

## Usage

These webpack configuration parts are intended to be used with [webpack-merge](https://npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge) although it is not required. The expected composition pattern is explained in the ["Composing Configuration" page from the SurviveJS webpack book](https://survivejs.com/webpack/developing/composing-configuration) written by an ex-webpack core team member, Juho Vepsäläinen.
