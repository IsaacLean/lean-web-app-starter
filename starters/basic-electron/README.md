# Basic Electron Starter

This is a **[Lean JS App Starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter)** project for a vanilla JavaScript application targeted for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

_If you need TypeScript, then use the [Basic Electron starter (TypeScript)](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter/tree/v1.0.0-rc/starters/basic-electron-ts) instead._

## Technology Overview

-   [Electron](https://electronjs.org): Framework for building desktop apps through [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) & [Chromium](https://chromium.org/chromium-projects)
-   [CSS](https://w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html): The standard language for styling
-   [Embedded JavaScript (EJS)](https://ejs.co): Templating language used to generate the build's `index.html` document
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io): Testing framework
-   [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io): API mocking library used to mock network requests
-   [Playwright](https://playwright.dev): End-to-end (E2E) testing
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org): Bundler used to create builds
-   [Babel](https://babeljs.io): Compiler used with webpack to output Electron-compatible code
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org): Linter used to identify problems in JavaScript
-   [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io): Linter used to identify problems in CSS
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io): Formatter used to enforce code style
-   [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): Pre-commit hooks to check for lint and formatting errors before Git commits are made
-   [npm](https://npmjs.com): Package manager

## Getting Started

First, [**download the starter project's ZIP file**](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter/releases/download/v1.0.0-rc/ljas-basic-electron_1-0-0.zip) and extract it.

Then, choose one of the following methods:

1. [Initialization Script (Recommended)](#method-1-initialization-script-recommended)
2. [Manual Installation](#method-2-manual-installation)

### Method 1: Initialization Script (Recommended)

This method is the simplest.

#### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is that you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed.

This was tested on Node.js v20.9.0, but any version >= 20.9 to <21 should still work.

#### Step 1. Run the initialization script

Open a terminal and run the init script in the project root directory which will execute all the setup commands like `npm install` for you:

```console
bash init.sh
```

_[Learn exactly what the init script is doing in method 2.](#method-2-manual-installation)_

#### Step 2. Start the development build

Start the dev build with this `package.json` script:

```console
npm run dev
```

When you're done working, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the dev build to shut it down.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

This method manually does what the init script does for you.

#### Prerequisites

The only prerequisite is that you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) installed.

This was tested on Node.js v20.9.0, but any version >= 20.9 to <21 should still work.

#### Step 1. Install npm dependencies & devDependencies

First, open a terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and install npm dependencies with the following command:

```console
npm ci
```

_Learn more about [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-install) in the npm Docs._

#### Step 2. Create a `.env` file

Copy the `.env.example` file and paste it as `.env`. This can be done with this command:

```console
cp .env.example .env
```

_Learn more about how this project handles environment variable files with the [`dotenv` package from its `README.md`](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)._

#### Step 3. Create a development build

Create a dev build with webpack using this command:

```console
npm run build
```

For more information on the build process, please read the ["Building" document in the LJAS docs](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter/blob/v1.0.0-rc/docs/building.md).

#### Step 4. Start the development build

Finally, start the dev build with following command:

```console
npm run dev
```

When you're done working, you can press Ctrl+C in the terminal running the dev build to shut it down.
