# Todo List (Legacy)

This is a todo list [single-page application (SPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) written in JavaScript and [Flow](https://flow.org) with [React](https://react.dev) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org). It simulates interaction with a mock backend API.

Note that this project utilizes React class components, classic Redux, and Enzyme. If you want to see an example of modern Redux using Redux Toolkit, please checkout the [**\*chan** example](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter/tree/master/starters/starchan).

Be aware that this was ported from LJAS v0.1.1 is classified as a legacy project. That means it lacks a few features the other projects have (such as Playwright) and will not receive future upgrades for many of its dependencies.

## Live Demo

You can try a live demo of this app here:  
**https://todo-list-jk0o.onrender.com**

_Note this uses [Render](https://render.com)'s free service so if the project hasn't been visited in a while, the initial page load may take longer than usual since the service has to be spun up. Also if the budget of free hours has been used up, the project will fail to load._

## Technology Overview

This project extends the [**React + Browser** starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter/tree/master/starters/react-browser) with the following:

-   [Flow](https://flow.org)
-   [Redux](https://redux.js.org)
-   [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)
-   [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme)
-   [Sublime Text](https://sublimetext.com)

The remaining technologies are inherited from the starter:

-   [React](https://react.dev): Library for user interfaces
-   [CSS](https://w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html): The standard language for styling
-   [Embedded JavaScript (EJS)](https://ejs.co): Templating language used to generate the build's `index.html` document
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io): Testing framework used mainly for unit testing
-   [Mock Service Worker (MSW)](https://mswjs.io): API mocking library used to mock network requests
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org): Bundler used to create builds
-   [Babel](https://babeljs.io): Compiler used with webpack to output cross-browser compatible code
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org): Linter used to identify problems in JavaScript
-   [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io): Linter used to identify problems in CSS
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io): Formatter used to enforce code style
-   [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): Pre-commit hooks to check for lint and formatting errors before Git commits are made
-   [Docker](https://docker.com): Used for an optional containerized development environment
