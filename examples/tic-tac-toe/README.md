# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) game written in [JavaScript](https://tc39.es/ecma262) and [React](https://react.dev).

Aside from the standard tic-tac-toe experience, it also features time travel timeline which allows you to review the game's history and "jump back" to past moves.

## Live Demo

_Note this uses [Render](https://render.com)'s free service so if the project hasn't been visited in a while, the initial page load may take longer than usual since the service has to be spun up. Also if the budget of free hours has been used up, the project will fail to load._
