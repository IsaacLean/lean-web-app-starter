This is a [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) editor desktop app written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) with [Electron](https://electronjs.org) and [React](https://react.dev).

The app has the following features:

- Support for [GitHub flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm)
- Real-time preview of markdown
- [Light mode](./src/playwright/color-mode.test.ts-snapshots/light-mode-chromium-darwin.png) & [dark mode](./src/playwright/color-mode.test.ts-snapshots/dark-mode-chromium-darwin.png)
- Focus mode that reduces UI elements to the essentials for those that prefer a minimalist user experience
- Export markdown preview as HTML
