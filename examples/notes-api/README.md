# Notes API

This is a [representational state transfer (REST) API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) server for a notes app written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) with [Express](https://expressjs.com) and [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org).

The server has the following features:

-   User registration with passwords encrypted by [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
-   User sessions implemented with [JSON web tokens (JWTs)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
-   Authorization system that restricts data accessibility of each note to the user that creates them
-   Request validation & sanitization with [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io)
-   [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification) definitions with documentation generated by [Swagger](https://swagger.io)
-   [Postman](https://postman.com) collection & environment available as an alternative to Swagger

## Live Demo

You can access a demo of the API live here:

```

```

You can read the docs for it here:  
**https://notes-api-15yz.onrender.com/api/v1/docs**

_Note this uses [Render](https://render.com)'s free service so if the project hasn't been visited in a while, the initial page load may take longer than usual since the service has to be spun up. Also if the budget of free hours has been used up, the project will fail to load._

## Technology Overview

This project extends the [`express-postgres-ts` starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-js-app-starter/tree/master/starters/express-postgres-ts) with the following:

-   [Swagger](https://swagger.io), [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification)
-   [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io)
-   [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)
-   [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)
-   [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet)
-   [Embedded JavaScript (EJS)](https://ejs.co)
-   [Postman](https://postman.com)

The remaining technologies are inherited from the starter:

-   [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org): JavaScript with type safety
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): Runtime environment that allows JavaScript to execute outside of web browsers
-   [Express](https://expressjs.com): Web framework for Node.js
-   [Prisma](https://prisma.io): Node.js object relational mapper (ORM) used to work with PostgreSQL
-   [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org): Relational database
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io): Testing framework
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org): Bundler used to create builds
-   [Babel](https://babeljs.io): Compiler used with webpack to support TypeScript and output Node.js-compatible code
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org): Linter used to identify problems in TypeScript & JavaScript
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io): Formatter used to enforce code style
-   [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) + [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): Pre-commit hooks to check for type, lint, and formatting errors before Git commits are made
-   [Docker](https://docker.com): Used for an optional containerized development environment
