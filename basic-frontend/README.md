# Basic Node.js Starter Project (JavaScript)

This is a starter for a React-based frontend project.

Note that this uses JavaScript. If you want the TypeScript equivalent to this, use the [basic-frontend-ts](../basic-frontend-ts) project instead.

## Getting Started

### Standard Method

### Docker Development Environment

Alternatively, you can also run the Docker development environment which only requires an installation of [Docker](https://www.docker.com). This was tested on Docker Desktop 4.20.0, but many other Docker installations should work.

Then all you need to do is run the following command to start the development server:

```
docker compose up
```

## Technologies

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com): Used as an optional development environment. This can be handy if you want more consistency across different machines with minimal setup.
-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org): Linter to quickly find problems.
-   [Jest](https://jestjs.io): Testing framework to ensure code correctness and coverage.
-   [Prettier](https://prettier.io): Formatter to enforce code style.
-   [webpack](https://webpack.js.org): Bundler used to build the app.
