# Stylelint Configuration

## Overview

All frontend related projects have a [Stylelint config file](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/configure) called `.stylelintrc.json` in the project's root directory. Alongside that file is also a `.stylelintignore` file which is responsible for telling Stylelint which files and directories should be skipped while linting.
