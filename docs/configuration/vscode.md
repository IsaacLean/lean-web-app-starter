# Visual Studio Code Configuration

You can find all the existing [configurations for the Visual Studio Code workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings#_workspace-settings) in the `.vscode/` directory which will contain the following files:

-   `settings.json`: Persisted and shareable editor settings
    -   `editor.formatOnSave`: This setting is set to `true` by default so [Prettier](https://prettier.io) can format code every time you save. If you want to disable this functionality, set this option to `false`.
-   `launch.json`: Run and debug settings
-   `extensions.json`: Determines which extensions show up as recommended in the extensions view
