# Visual Studio Code

You can find all the existing configurations for [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com) in the `.vscode` directory:

-   `settings.json`: Persisted and shareable editor settings
-   `launch.json`: Run and debug settings
-   `extensions.json`: Determines which extensions show up as recommended in the extensions view

_`settings.json` will have `editor.formatOnSave` set to `true` by default so Prettier can format code every time you save. If you want to disable this functionality, set this option to `false`._
