## Prevalence of webpack

Believe it or not, the time where setting up your development environment from scratch or using Create React App was actually not too long ago (even though it may feel like an eternity already). So while Vite has gained a significant portion of the project starter space, there are still a ton of active codebases that are running their own custom webpack configurations or relying on Create React App which is webpack based.

You may have inherited a codebase that falls into this generation and need direction on how to make updates to those configurations, in which case LJAS can be useful as a reference to see how how you can tailor your non-LJAS but still webpack-based configuration to your needs.

By choosing webpack, you'll have access to the most potential solutions on Google, GitHub, StackOverflow, etc.
