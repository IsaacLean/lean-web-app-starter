# Prettier Configuration

## Overview

The [Prettier configuration file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/configuration) can be found as the `.prettierrc.json` file in the project's root directory.

Prettier's [exclusion of files](https://prettier.io/docs/en/ignore) is controlled through the `.prettierignore` and and `.gitignore` files in the project's root directory.

## Sort Imports Plugin

By default, LJAS sets up a plugin for Prettier that sorts import declarations. [More information can be found about within its `README.md`.](https://github.com/trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports)
