# Origins

LJAS originally started as [Lean React Starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-react-starter) because it was created in a time period where there wasn't exactly a standardized project starter for the React ecosystem yet. We chose [webpack](https://webpack.js.org) because it was doing what we were already configuring [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) to do out-of-the-box, not to mention it was becoming the standard build tool for React apps. The starter concept was expanded to Express and MongoDB with [Lean Express/Mongo Starter](https://github.com/mattlean/lean-express-mongo-starter) as we had the desire to bring the React development experience to the backend.

Later, Lean React Starter and Lean Express/MongoDB Starter were merged to create the first version of Lean JS App Starter, despite this being done during [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)'s peak in popularity. Even though there was a lot of overlap in value, we still moved forward with LJAS because we saw that it could stand out in two ways. This first was that LJAS could act as a kind of "Create React App for non-React projects" like Node.js and Electron projects. The second was that we decided to approach configuration with a different philosophy by making it completely transparent, contrary to Create React App's decision to obfuscate it and expect users to [eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject) if they wanted to make major config customizations.
